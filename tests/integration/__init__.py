"""Integration tests for the HERON multi-agent framework.

These tests verify the core functionalities of HERON:
1. Hierarchical agent structure (Field L1 → Coordinator L2 → System L3)
2. Message-based inter-agent communication
3. Event-driven discrete simulation with heterogeneous tick rates
4. Visibility-based information filtering
5. Multi-agent environment integration
