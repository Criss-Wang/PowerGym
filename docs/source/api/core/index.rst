Core
====

Core abstractions for PowerGrid's modular state/action/observation system and coordination protocols.

**Key Components:**

- **State**: Feature-based state representation with visibility control
- **Action**: Flexible continuous/discrete actions with normalization
- **Observation**: Structured observations with local/global/message components
- **Protocols**: Coordination mechanisms for hierarchical and peer-to-peer control
- **Policies**: Decision-making interfaces for RL and rule-based control
