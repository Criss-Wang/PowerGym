    "# Tutorial 1: Understanding HERON\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Understand what HERON solves and why its design matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time:** ~5 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to train RL agents for a **power grid with multiple microgrids**. Each microgrid has devices (generators, batteries) managed by a coordinator. Seems simple—until you realize:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Challenge | What It Means |\n",
    "|-----------|---------------|\n",
    "| **Hierarchical Control** | Devices → Microgrids → System Operator |\n",
    "| **Partial Observability** | A battery shouldn't see the entire grid |\n",
    "| **Realistic Timing** | Real systems have delays and different update rates |\n",
    "| **Swappable Coordination** | Test price signals vs setpoints vs consensus |\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Typical Approach (Without HERON)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Manually filter observations for each agent\n",
    "def get_obs_for_battery(global_state):\n",
    "    return global_state['battery_1']['soc']  # Manual filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_obs_for_microgrid(global_state):\n",
    "    return np.concatenate([\n",
    "        global_state['battery_1']['soc'],\n",
    "        global_state['gen_1']['output'],\n",
    "        # ... 20 more lines of manual filtering\n",
    "    ])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Rewrite for each coordination protocol\n",
    "if protocol == 'setpoint':\n",
    "    # ... 50 lines of setpoint logic\n",
    "elif protocol == 'price_signal':\n",
    "    # ... 50 different lines\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** 500+ lines of boilerplate, tightly coupled, hard to experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### With HERON\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BatterySOC(FeatureProvider):\n",
    "    visibility = ['owner', 'upper_level']  # Declarative - no filtering code\n",
    "    soc: float = 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyEnv(PettingZooParallelEnv):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        super().__init__(env_id=\"my_env\")\n",
    "        self.register_agent(microgrid)  # HERON handles the rest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** ~50 lines, clean separation of concerns, easy experimentation."

    "## The Key Insight: Agent-Centric vs Environment-Centric\n",
    "\n",
    "**PettingZoo (environment-centric):** The environment decides everything.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Environment controls what each agent sees\n",
    "obs = env.step(actions)  # Black box - how does env filter observations?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**HERON (agent-centric):** Agents are first-class citizens.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Each feature declares its own visibility\n",
    "class BatterySOC(FeatureProvider):\n",
    "    visibility = ['owner', 'upper_level']  # Battery + coordinator can see\n",
    "\n",
    "# Agent observes based on its level in hierarchy\n",
    "obs = agent.observe()  # Automatically filtered by visibility rules\n",

    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "| Traditional Approach | HERON Approach |\n",
    "|---------------------|----------------|\n",
    "| Observation filtering is manual | Visibility is declarative (`visibility = [...]`) |\n",
    "| Protocol logic mixed with agent logic | Protocols are pluggable components |\n",

    "### 2. Agent — Autonomous Entity\n",
    "Has state, observes, acts. Two types: `FieldAgent` (devices) and `CoordinatorAgent` (managers).\n",

    "        self.state.features['soc'].soc += action[0] * 0.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Protocol — Coordination Mechanism\n",
    "Defines how coordinators and devices communicate. Swap without changing agent code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "microgrid = SimpleMicrogrid(protocol=SetpointProtocol())      # Direct control\n",
    "# OR\n",

    "# OR\n",
    "microgrid = SimpleMicrogrid(protocol=ConsensusProtocol())     # Distributed\n",

    "### 4. Environment Adapter — RL Framework Bridge\n",
    "Wraps HERON agents for RLlib/StableBaselines compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyEnv(PettingZooParallelEnv):  # HERON adapter\n",
